<!-- questions for Aaron after class:

Replacing hero with an image tag results in the final image being stretched unpleasantly. Is there any way to fix this or would it be preferable that I simply replace the hero div with a figure tag. Is it important for this image to have alt text? Is there a way to do that with the css background image setup?

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
